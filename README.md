# CyRSoXS: GPU enabled RSoXS simulation

* CyRSoXS is a GPU-accelerated codebase that calculates resonant X-ray scattering in the Born Approximation. It takes a voxel-based model and optical constants as input, and returns simulated X-ray scattering patterns. These models can be derived from real space measurements (AFM, TEM, 4DSTEM), or synthetically generated using procedural morphology generators.
Currently, it supports both 32 bit and 64 bit float data types.

* The code can be executed through Python (enabled through [Pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11))
or directly through the executable.

## Version  : 1.1.8.0

The developer version of the CyRSoXS code is available at <https://bitbucket.org/baskargroup/cy-rsoxs>. All stable future releases will be merged with the current usnistgov repository.

## Dependencies

### Hardware

* CUDA GPU with [Compute Capability](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/cuda-compatibility/index.html) >=7
  * CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model creaded by NVIDIA

### Required Dependencies for building from source

* A C++ compiler with C++14 support is required.
* gcc >= 7 (CUDA specific versions might have GCC requirements)
* CUDA Toolkit (>=9)
* HDF5
  * Hierarchical Data Format (version 5) is a set of file formats designed to store and organize large amounts of data. CyRSoXS uses it to store models and simulated scattering patterns
* OpenMP
* libconfig==1.7.2

### Additional dependencies for building with Pybind

* Python >= 3.6

### Optional Dependencies

* Doxygen - for building the documentation.
* Docker - if you want to run CyRSoXS in a Docker container.
